## About Dev Launchers

Dev Launchers is a nonprofit organization building an inclusive, software focused incubator giving teen students from diverse backgrounds the skills and resources necessary to succeed in careers touched by technology. This repository holds the beginnings of the online platform we're creating in order to first impart the general skills required for students to begin their own projects, and then support their exploration as they tackle building something they're excited about. It also functions as our organization's website! 

Weâ€™re currently partnered with the Austin Public Library and run weekly labs for teen students, where we connect them with mentors and professionals from a variety of industries. Our students come up with their own app and game ideas and we build up their skills in order to help them reach their goals! During this process our students learn in-depth coding, design, and collaborative skills. Most importantly, though, they form relationships which set them up to be successful throughout the rest of their lives.

### Our Issues are organized into different Milestones

*We're using GitHub's milestones to keep better track of our issues. These will change as we progress and move further along with our roadmap. The current milestone's we're tackling are:*
    
#### [Showing Impact - Let's Bring Life to the Site! (And Get Sponsorships)](https://github.com/dev-launchers/platform__website/milestone/7)
 - We want to showcase all the wonderful things Dev Launchers is accomplishing, and the wonderful people making it all happen! This milestone should result in donors and sponsors alike getting a clear idea of what Dev Launchers is all about, and why they should support our mission.
    
#### [Student UX/Curriculum Creation and Curation (2)](https://github.com/dev-launchers/platform__website/milestone/9)
 - Our students need more content teaching them the fundamentals of JavaScript and Visual Design, and then preparing them to work on either React applications or Phaser 3 games.

#### [General Site Improvements](https://github.com/dev-launchers/platform__website/milestone/8)
 - The site UI/UX needs some work, let's make it quite dandy-er
